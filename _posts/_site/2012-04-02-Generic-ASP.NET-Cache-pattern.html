<p>I seem to search for this little nugget every now and again without finding it on the net, so here it is&#8230;</p>

<h2 id='what_to_cache'>What to cache</h2>

<p>Typical usage is data for populating dropdown lists with options which doesn&#8217;t change too often, like once a day. This is probably the most frequently used data from a database, so making the app hit the db only once per day(per list) can really make a difference if you have some load.</p>

<h2 id='how_to_cache'>How to cache</h2>

<p>The ASP.NET HttpCache is really simple and can be used for all types of .net applications(I have used it mainly in web-apps, but also in a wcf-project). The reason for having the caching logic isolated in a class is it&#8217;s really easy to get the locking wrong.</p>

<h2 id='le_code'>Le code</h2>

<p>There really isn&#8217;t much to it, except for the double checking.</p>

<pre><code>Somecode(&#39;hmm&#39;);</code></pre>

<p>Your only concern using it is which lock-object to give it. I usually make a &#8220;retriever&#8221; class for each list I need, and give the cache the typeof(MyListRetriever) to use for locking.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>Somemorecode(&#39;haha&#39;, 1);</code></pre>
